Puppet module for Torquebox

This a Puppet module for Torquebox extracted from the excellent book Deploying with JRuby: Deliver Scalable Web Apps using the JVM by Joe Kutner (@jkutner).

It is only compatible with Vagrant, DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.

I will be improving this module as I learn more about Puppet and as I start needing it in production for my current projet.
